# forestanza
orig. "stanza of the fore" -- the foremost strophe of utter importance

Foreign texts reading and translation assistance toolset

## Distribution
  * Bundle of narrow-purpose tools
  * GUI/cli control panels for chaining tools
  * Viewer with profiles, adapted for readers/translators

### Faster reading speed for WN
  * Assistance in learning Japanese/Chinese/etc.
  * Enhanced sentence comprehension speed.

### Tools for TL
  * Goal: reduce mental fatigue.
  * Eliminate the most frustrating/irritating/monotonous tasks.
    - Develop niche scripts.
    - Glue together existing tools.

At the end, I can't hope for something more then interactive helper,
similar to binary code disassemblers. After all, natural language
processing is much more difficult then deterministic machine language.

## Motivation
  * In fact, I'm spending my resting time, creating these utils for people.
  * I hope to compensate it by reading more of their translations,
    instead of reading raws myself.
  * Of course, the efforts will be repaid only when all TLs in total will be
    producing more content, than I able to read in raws by myself in the
    comparable time.
  * It's utopia, though:
    - Many translators with interesting projects must be involved to satisfy
      that condition.
    - My foreign languages proficiency is constantly improving, making it even
      harder to satisfy.
    - Actually, saturation margin for reading time isn't that high in real life.
    - Improved proficiency will nullifying my gains from the project in
      future, eliminating the original reasons itself.
  * Community wins anyway. Gracias to contributors.

## Fair usage
  * You are translating for fun -- and I'm coding for fun.
  * You need some profit to translate (donate, etc) -- [either need I](
    https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.en.html).
  * If you constantly use this software being satisfied as reader --
    try to reward developer -- in any way you consider reasonable.
